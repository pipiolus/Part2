Last set of exercises of part3. This was DEFINETILY the most challenging exercise I've come across untill this moment (sep 23).
It was realy frustrating (if you see my git log it came to a point where I literaly restarted the entire app) but also realy exciting and very fun to spend all the hours that it took to get it done. I had to refactor the entire app when it needed to work by clicking buttons to display a country, so I ended up solving it by making a particular API call to that specific country, and render that country in a new component.
The weather part was also challenging, and made me read a lot of useful and fun stuff that I ended up including in the project (like the loading state).

HOW TO USE IT: Is pretty straigthforward!ðŸ˜‚ Just write the name of any country that you want (IN ENGLISH) and it will do the job for you! Have fun!
